In recent events, Verde Mining has seen the addition of Daniel Fernandez, a UTPB senior, serving as an intern for the summer. With this addition to the team, the major problem with the website has been resolved.

The team has some substatial projects in the works, so expect to see more activity from Verde Mining in the near future!
